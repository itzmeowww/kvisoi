# KVISOI

A simple web application that judges codes, made for KVIS Olympiad in Informatics Club.

## Instruction

### To run the program

1. download **JUST** the deploy_env directory
2. edit the docker-compose.yml file. correct the site configuration.
3. deploy using `docker-compose up`
4. run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` in the docker shell (if needed)

### To add Tasks

1. access the admin page and add new task object
2. upload the task input and output to the /grader_config/tasks/<task_id>
3. don't forget the manifest.json

### To access admin page

1. create new superuser by `python manage.py createsuperuser`
2. access /admin and login

### To contribute

1. Fork this project and make a PR!

## Concerns

### API route is not blocked

- Anyone can send request to certain endpoint to fake judge result
- to be fix by restricting those endpoints from external access
  - Traefik can handle this (waiting for the next update for a neat implementation)

## Things to be improved

- Templates obviously (responsive will be appreciated)
- Use websocket to update submission
- Write tests
- Table pagination and search
- Ability to rejudge (for admin)
- Contest management ?
- Better profile page
- Some kind of automation in adding a task
- Add subission timestamp (cause why not)
- Docker Mount `local_settings`
